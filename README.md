Using the virtual hardware capability of MCU 8051 IDE, interface P1 to a sevensegment display in the common cathode configuration. Write a main program to display all the courses you are currently taking this semester one by one in four digits using four seven-segment displays. For example, if the currently taken courses are EEE212, EEE202, MATH242, HUM112, ENG401, then we would be continuously displaying the pattern 0212, 0202, 1242, 2112, 3401, 0212, 0202, on the four seven segment displays. For other departments, use other codes, i..e., most significant digit, you find appropriate.
